*Figure 3:* Quantitative comparison between two network shows clear differences in network performance
Network used : *Simulated* and *image-fed* A.) Intensity histogram of all the segmented objects B.) Volume versus intensity for all the objects segmented for the two networks C.) Intensity versus label ID for the two networks. Every labeled objects is attributed a unique label by the network D.) Intensity profile in the high intensity region for both networks. The high intensity has been set using the camera properties and the maximum pixel value.
