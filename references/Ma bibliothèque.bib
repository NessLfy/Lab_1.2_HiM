  abstract = {CRISPR is becoming an indispensable tool in biological research. Once known as the bacterial immune system against invading viruses, the programmable capacity of the Cas9 enzyme is now revolutionizing diverse fields of medical research, biotechnology, and agriculture. CRISPR-Cas9 is no longer just a gene-editing tool; the application areas of catalytically impaired inactive Cas9, including gene regulation, epigenetic editing, chromatin engineering, and imaging, now exceed the gene-editing functionality of WT Cas9. Here, we will present a brief history of gene-editing tools and describe the wide range of CRISPR-based genome-targeting tools. We will conclude with future directions and the broader impact of CRISPR technologies.},

  abstract = {Diatoms are a major storehouse of valuable fucoxanthin and polyunsaturated fatty acids, with enormous nutraceuticals and biofuel potential. Three marine diatom species isolated from the southern coast of India has been screened and their results show that highest biomass concentration and fucoxanthin yield was obtained in Chaetoceros sp. as 0.217~g~L−1 and 0.403~mg~L−1 respectively. Lipid \% as dry cell weight was maximum in Thalassiosira sp. (52\%) followed by Skeletonema sp. (44\%) and Chaetoceros sp. (22\%). However, protein and secondary metabolites content besides the total antioxidant activity was estimated highest in Skeletonema sp. Having strong inhibition zones of 18–20~mm against all the five strains of bacteria also highlights the highest antibacterial prospect in Skeletonema sp. This work manifests the plasticity of diatoms and may provide useful insights for further species-specific selection for large-scale production of eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, fucoxanthin and other metabolites with potential health benefits.},

  abstract = {Atomic resolution structure determinations of proteins by X-ray crystallography are formidable multidisciplinary undertakings, requiring protein construct design, expression and purification, crystallization trials, phase determination, and model building. Modern mass spectrometric methods can greatly facilitate these obligate tasks. Thus, mass spectrometry can be used to verify that the desired protein construct has been correctly expressed, to define compact domains in the target protein, to assess the components contained within the protein crystals, and to screen for successful incorporation of seleno-methionine and other heavy metal reagents used for phasing. In addition, mass spectrometry can be used to address issues of modeling, topology, and side-chain proximity. Here, we demonstrate how rational use of mass spectrometry assists and expedites high resolution X-ray structure determination through each stage of the process of protein crystallography.},

  abstract = {Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is epidemic in the United States, even rivaling HIV/AIDS in its public health impact. The pandemic clone USA300, like other CA-MRSA strains, expresses Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), a pore-forming toxin that targets polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). PVL is thought to play a key role in the pathogenesis of necrotizing pneumonia, but data from rodent infection models are inconclusive. Rodent PMNs are less susceptible than human PMNs to PVL-induced cytolysis, whereas rabbit PMNs, like those of humans, are highly susceptible to PVL-induced cytolysis. This difference in target cell susceptibility could affect results of experimental models. Therefore, we developed a rabbit model of necrotizing pneumonia to compare the virulence of a USA300 wild-type strain with that of isogenic PVL-deletion mutant and -complemented strains. PVL enhanced the capacity of USA300 to cause severe lung necrosis, pulmonary edema, alveolar hemorrhage, hemoptysis, and death, hallmark clinical features of fatal human necrotizing pneumonia. Purified PVL instilled directly into the lung caused lung inflammation and injury by recruiting and lysing PMNs, which damage the lung by releasing cytotoxic granule contents. These findings provide insights into the mechanism of PVL-induced lung injury and inflammation and demonstrate the utility of the rabbit for studying PVL-mediated pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {Bacterial adaptive immune systems use CRISPRs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins for RNA-guided nucleic acid cleavage. Although most prokaryotic adaptive immune systems generally target DNA substrates, type III and VI CRISPR systems direct interference complexes against single-stranded RNA substrates. In type VI systems, the single-subunit C2c2 protein functions as an RNA-guided RNA endonuclease (RNase). How this enzyme acquires mature CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that are essential for immune surveillance and how it carries out crRNA-mediated RNA cleavage remain unclear. Here we show that bacterial C2c2 possesses a unique RNase activity responsible for CRISPR RNA maturation that is distinct from its RNA-activated single-stranded RNA degradation activity. These dual RNase functions are chemically and mechanistically different from each other and from the crRNA-processing behaviour of the evolutionarily unrelated CRISPR enzyme Cpf1 (ref. 11). The two RNase activities of C2c2 enable multiplexed processing and loading of guide RNAs that in turn allow sensitive detection of cellular transcripts.},

Furthermore, tools are provided for model validation as well as interfaces to external programs for refinement, validation and graphics. The software is designed to be easy to learn for novice users, which is achieved by ensuring that tools for common tasks are `discoverable' through familiar user-interface elements (menus and toolbars) or by intuitive behaviour (mouse controls). Recent developments have focused on providing tools for expert users, with~customisable key bindings, extensions and an extensive scripting interface. The software is under rapid development, but has already achieved very widespread use within the crystallographic community. The current state of the software is presented, with a description of the facilities available and of some of the underlying methods employed.},

However, the precise interplay between chromatin structure and gene expression is still unclear, particularly within multicellular developing organisms. In the present study, we employ Hi-M, a single-cell spatial genomics approach, to detect CRM–promoter looping interactions within topologically associating domains (TADs) during early Drosophila development. By comparing cis-regulatory loops in alternate cell types, we show that physical proximity does not necessarily instruct transcriptional states. Moreover, multi-way analyses reveal that multiple CRMs spatially coalesce to form hubs. Loops and CRM hubs are established early during development, before the emergence of TADs. Moreover, CRM hubs are formed, in part, via the action of the pioneer transcription factor Zelda and precede transcriptional activation. Our approach provides insight into the role of CRM–promoter interactions in defining transcriptional states, as well as distinct cell types.},

  abstract = {Finessing Crystal Analysis                            Protein crystallography has revolutionized our understanding of a whole variety of biological processes (see the Perspective by                                Evans                              ). In crystallography, the measure of agreement between the data and the calculated model is not on the same scale as the measure of data quality, making it challenging to choose an optimal high resolution limit beyond which the data should be discarded. Now,               Karplus and Diederichs               (p.               1030               ) introduce a statistical model that assesses agreement of model and data accuracy on the same scale. Determining the structures of biological macromolecules by x-ray crystallography requires solving the phase problem. The two techniques that dominate phase evaluation (multi- and single-wavelength anomalous diffraction) rely on element-specific scattering from incorporated heavy atoms.                                Liu                 et al.                              (p.               1033               ) present procedures for routine structure determination of native proteins with no heavy atom incorporation. The technique, which relies on combining data from multiple crystals, was used to determine the structures of four native proteins, including a 1200-residue complex.                        ,              A statistical method places model and data quality on the same scale and indicates how far one can model.           ,                             In macromolecular x-ray crystallography, refinement               R               values measure the agreement between observed and calculated data. Analogously,               R               merge               values reporting on the agreement between multiple measurements of a given reflection are used to assess data quality. Here, we show that despite their widespread use,               R               merge               values are poorly suited for determining the high-resolution limit and that current standard protocols discard much useful data. We introduce a statistic that estimates the correlation of an observed data set with the underlying (not measurable) true signal; this quantity, CC*, provides a single statistically valid guide for deciding which data are useful. CC* also can be used to assess model and data quality on the same scale, and this reveals when data quality is limiting model improvement.},

Sea water samples were collected every hours to evaluate time-related variations of phytoplankton concentrations and to compare the relative ratio of \emph{A. catenella{$<$}i/{$>$} versus other phytoplankton species during the outbreak. From these observations, trials using recirculated sea water systems were performed to: i) evaluate the physiological effects on oyster of increasing proportions of \emph{A. catenella{$<$}i/{$>$} within a mixed microalgal diet where the non-toxic diatom \emph{Thalassiosira weissflogii{$<$}i/{$>$} was present at concentration: 1500 cells ml\textsuperscript{−1{$<$}sup/{$>$}, ii) compare the effect of two temperatures (12 °C and 18 °C) on paralytic toxin accumulation rates in oyster flesh by ion-pairing high performance liquid chromatography (IP-HPLC) detection, iii) analyse toxin biotransformation during the contamination process, iv) evaluate the role of the different types of oyster tissue on the bioaccumulation mechanism.The results showed: i) a significant effect of temperature increase on clearance rate and toxin uptake, ii) no detectable time-related effects of toxic algal food on pre-ingestion sorting or on toxin profiles in oyster flesh, iii) either negative or positive effects of \emph{A. catenella{$<$}i/{$>$} concentrations on toxin uptake (“threshold” effect), iv) high amounts of toxins in the digestive gland, accounting for more than 80\% of overall shellfish toxicity. The daily amount of toxins (\emph{Q{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{tox{$<$}sub/{$>$}) taken up by each oyster was evaluated by means of a global one-compartment model.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             An international outbreak linked to oyster consumption involving a group of over 200 people in Italy and 127 total subjects in 13 smaller clusters in France was analyzed using epidemiological and clinical data and shellfish samples. Environmental information from the oyster-producing area, located in a lagoon in southern France, was collected to investigate the possible events leading to the contamination. Virologic analyses were conducted by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using the same primer sets for both clinical and environmental samples. After sequencing, the data were analyzed through the database operated by the scientific network FoodBorne Viruses in Europe. The existence of an international collaboration between laboratories was critical to rapidly connect the data and to fully interpret the results, since it was not obvious that one food could be the link because of the diversity of the several norovirus strains involved in the different cases. It was also demonstrated that heavy rain was responsible for the accidental contamination of seafood, leading to a concentration of up to hundreds of genomic copies per oyster as detected by real-time RT-PCR.},

REFMAC5 utilizes different likelihood functions depending on the diffraction data employed (amplitudes or intensities), the presence of twinning and the availability of SAD/SIRAS experimental diffraction data. To ensure chemical and structural integrity of~the refined model, REFMAC5 offers several classes of restraints and choices of model parameterization. Reliable models at resolutions at least as low as 4\hspace{0.25em}Å can be achieved thanks to low-resolution refinement tools such as secondary-structure restraints, restraints to known homologous structures, automatic global and local NCS restraints, `jelly-body' restraints and the use of novel long-range restraints on atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) based on the Kullback–Leibler divergence. REFMAC5 additionally offers TLS parameterization and, when high-resolution data are available, fast refinement of anisotropic ADPs. Refinement in the~presence of twinning is performed in a fully automated fashion. REFMAC5 is a flexible and highly optimized refinement package that is ideally suited for refinement across the entire resolution spectrum encountered in macromolecular crystallography.},

These bacterial exotoxins share sequence and structural homology and target several host-cell types. Leukotoxin ED (LukED) is one of these bicomponent pore-forming toxins that Staphylococcus aureus produces in order to suppress the ability of the host to contain the infection. The recent delineation of the important role that LukED plays in S. aureus pathogenesis and the identification of its protein receptors, combined with its presence in S. aureus methicillin-resistant epidemic strains, establish this leukocidin as a possible target for the development of novel therapeutics. Here, the crystal structures of the water-soluble LukE and LukD components of LukED have been determined. The two structures illustrate the tertiary-structural variability with respect to the other leukotoxins while retaining the conservation of the residues involved in the interaction of the protomers in the bipartite leukotoxin in the pore complex.},

Based on the prey– predator interactions occurring among D. acuminata, M. rubra, and Teleaulax sp. in this study, establishment of permanent culture of the dinoflagellate D. acuminata may facilitate a better understanding of the ecophysiology, biology, and toxicology of Dinophysis species, as well as the evolution of dinoflagellate plastids.},

Molecular and ultra-structural data were used to classify the virus under the name ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1), as the first known species in the family Malacoherpesviridae. Since 2008, massive mortality outbreaks were reported in several Crassostrea gigas oyster farms in France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom.

  abstract = {Diatoms are of great interest for many biotechnological applications. The present study highlights the compar­ ative analysis for mass cultivation under the effect of seawater made from table salt (TS), rock salt (RS), and synthetic seawater in the presence of normal silica and induction coupled plasma (ICP) nanosilica (Nano Si) for inducing diatom growth. Out of all the test formulations, RS-f/2 Nano Si showed the best results with maximum cell density (3.16x107±0.04 and 3.24x107±0.05 cells mL− 1), carbohydrate (403.0±3.4 and 398.0±8.1 mg g− 1), and chrysolaminarin yield (66.2±5.5 and 49.3±5.1 mg g− 1) in both Chaetoceros gracilis and Thalassiosira weissflogii respectively. The presence of a rich pigment profile and lipids further highlights the importance of TS and RS for cost-effective mass culturing. Results reveal that mass cultivation of marine diatoms with TS and RS in the presence of nanosilica not only reduces costs but also enhances metabolite production.},

Increasingly, those interested in all branches of the biological sciences require structural information to shed light on previously unanswered questions. Furthermore, the availability of a protein structure can provide a more detailed focus for future research. The extension of the technique to systems such as viruses, immune complexes, and protein–nucleic acid complexes serves only to widen the appeal of crystallography. Structure based drug design, site directed mutagenesis, elucidation of enzyme mechanisms, and specificity of protein–ligand interactions are just a few of the areas in which x ray crystallography has provided clarification.},

Typically, validation software reports the number of residues belonging to “outlier,” “allowed,” and “favored” regions. While “zero unexplained outliers” can be considered the current “gold standard,” this can be misleading if deviations from expected distributions are not considered. We revisited the Ramachandran Z score (Rama-Z), a quality metric introduced more than two decades ago but underutilized. We describe a reimplementation of the Rama-Z score in the Computational Crystallography Toolbox along with an algorithm to estimate its uncertainty for individual models; final implementations are available in Phenix and PDB-REDO. We discuss the interpretation of the Rama-Z score and advocate including it in the validation reports provided by the Protein Data Bank. We also advocate reporting it alongside the outlier/allowed/favored counts in structural publications.},

An efficient method to remove bacteria from a laboratory culture of the marine dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense is presented in this paper. The alga was subjected to repeated washing, lysozyme/SDS and antibiotic treatment with a mixture of gentamycin, streptomycin, cephalothin and rifampicin. Axenic status was confirmed after subculturing three times in sterile f/2 medium without antibiotics. Bacteria could not be detected in various media, both solid and liquid, nor by epifluorescence microscopy and PCR amplification of 16S rDNA of both eubacteria and archaea. Bacterial presence was monitored throughout a full growth cycle and, following subculture, no bacteria were detected using the above methods. This method is more efficient and less time-consuming than other methods and the resultant axenic A. tamarense cultures would provide a simpler system for further study of bacteria–alga interactions.},

  abstract = {Mass spectrometry (MS) is a mainstream chemical analysis technique in the twenty-first century. It has contributed to numerous discoveries in chemistry, physics and biochemistry. Hundreds of research laboratories scattered all over the world use MS every day to investigate fundamental phenomena on the molecular level. MS is also widely used by industry—especially in drug discovery, quality control and food safety protocols. In some cases, mass spectrometers are indispensable and irreplaceable by any other metrological tools. The uniqueness of MS is due to the fact that it enables direct identification of molecules based on the mass-to-charge ratios as well as fragmentation patterns. Thus, for several decades now, MS has been used in qualitative chemical analysis. To address the pressing need for quantitative molecular measurements, a number of laboratories focused on technological and methodological improvements that could render MS a fully quantitative metrological platform. In this theme issue, the experts working for some of those laboratories share their knowledge and enthusiasm about quantitative MS. I hope this theme issue will benefit readers, and foster fundamental and applied research based on quantitative MS measurements. This article is part of the themed issue ‘Quantitative mass spectrometry’.},

Each antibody reacted with dinophysistoxin-1 ( = 35-methylokadaic acid) as well as okadaic acid, but did not react with the other diarrhetic shellfish poisons or related compounds, such as 7-O-palmitoyl-okadaic acid (analogue of dinophysistoxin-3), pectenotoxin-1 and yessotoxin. A competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay which employed OA-3 antibody was performed and showed a sensitivity of about 10ppb (10ng/ml) for okadaic acid. This simple and time-saving ELISA assay system may be useful for the specific detection of diarrhetic shellfish poisons.},
