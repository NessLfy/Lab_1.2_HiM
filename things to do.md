re run the training with jb data (done)
re segment
re plot the metrics to see if the training is the same as the first network
if so replot galleries between the first train network and the second trainined network (as the raw image) and check if all images previously segmented are also resegmented when the network was retrained
do the opposite way around also. 

Re run the training with correct jb data (monday)
