# Lab notebook repositories for our Lab1.2 project HiM
<<<<<<< HEAD

Welcome to our repositories. You will find 2 branches corresponding to our respective lab notebooks. 
=======

In this branch you will find my lab notebook separated per week with details. In this file is a general summary of everything that was done.

# Week 1: Introduction to linux

In this first week the goal was to get familiar with linux and the command line. Moreover get introduced to the concept of virtual machine, the git language and first glance at the pyHiM package.

# Week 2: Initiation to segmentation scripts

The goal for this week was to have a first experience with pyHiM by running it on a virtual machine on sample images and with the different segmentation scripts. The segmentation scripts were the 3D stardist and 2D cellpose

# Week 3: Network(s) testing

Testing of 3D/ 2D segmentation on new images for the networks. Comparison of 2 different segmentation networks in 3D (speed/accuracy). Begining of plotting segmentation result to evaluate accuracy of the segmentation :

- plotting the intensity per segmented object to see wether there could be different population which could correspond to a bad segmentation.

Outlooks to pursue:

- speed of 3D network compared to 2D network for all planes

- testing of cellpose 3D segmentation via 2D network

- further characterization of the results of segmentation

- finding other metrics.
